### **Green Auto-Scaler Pattern**

**Context:** Traditional auto-scalers focus mainly on CPU and memory utilization, but sustainability factors like **power consumption and CO₂ emissions** should also influence scaling decisions.

**Problem:**

- How can we dynamically **scale down** containers based on CPU, power usage, and CO₂ impact?
- How can we ensure that excess containers are removed **without disrupting performance**?
- How can we prioritize **eco-friendly compute resources** when deciding which containers to remove?

**Solution:**

1. **Monitor real-time sustainability metrics** (power, CO₂, CPU) using **telemetry agents** inside each node and container.
2. **Use a Green Scaling Controller (GSC)** that collects these metrics and makes smart removal decisions.
3. **Prioritize shutting down inefficient or dirty-energy instances first** while maintaining system performance.
4. **Use predictive scaling** to avoid unnecessary container spin-up/down cycles, reducing wasted energy.
5. **Integrate with cloud carbon-aware APIs** (e.g., **Carbon Aware SDK, Cloud Carbon Footprint**) to optimize instance selection.

### **🛠 Implementation Details**

#### **1️⃣ Real-Time Metrics Collection**

- **Install telemetry agents** (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) on nodes and containers to track:
  - **CPU Utilization (%)**
  - **Power Consumption (Watts per container/node)**
  - **CO₂ Emissions (gCO₂eq per request/transaction)**
- Use an **energy-aware load balancer** to route requests to the most efficient nodes.

#### **2️⃣ Intelligent Removal Strategy**

- Instead of removing containers **purely based on CPU**, use a **multi-factor decision model**:  
  **Priority Order for Removal:**
  1. **Containers on High-Carbon Footprint Nodes** (e.g., data centers using coal-based energy).
  2. **Low CPU Utilization Containers** (below a threshold, e.g., 10%).
  3. **High Power Consumption Containers** (based on per-container telemetry).
  4. **Idle or Near-Idle Containers** that haven't served traffic for a set duration.

#### **3️⃣ Smart Scaling Policies**

- Implement **Sustainable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** rules:
  
  - Scale **down** if the **CO₂ cost per request exceeds a threshold**.
  - Scale **up** only if the system load requires it **AND** eco-friendly resources are available.
  - **Predictive scaling** (avoid unnecessary removals that cause frequent rescheduling).

- Implement **"Eco-Aware Scheduling"** in Kubernetes:
  
  - Prefer **data centers using renewable energy** (e.g., **GCP Carbon-Aware Regions, AWS Sustainability API**).
  - Use **time-based scaling** (reduce containers during peak carbon hours, increase in low-carbon periods).

#### **4️⃣ Integration with Carbon-Aware APIs**

- Use APIs like:
  - **Carbon-Aware SDK** to fetch CO₂ intensity per data center.
  - **Cloud Carbon Footprint** to track real-time emissions.
  - **Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter)** to measure per-container energy use.
