# Microservices Style

Microservices Style has emerged as a paradigm related to code organization and deployement. This architectural style represents a departure from traditional larger deployment structures, offering a more modular, scalable, and flexible approach to building applications. 

Understanding of microservices as an architectural style which applies to software intensive systems which are built instead of bought, helps to align expectations about what they will do.

In many ways the microservices style is similar to any other remote destributed service call style like RPC and SOA. However, what clearly identifies microservices is the self-contained scope of the services themselves.

## Advantages

### Decomposition of Monoliths:

Microservices Architecture advocates the decomposition of large, monolithic applications into smaller, independent services. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function, promoting modular development and ease of maintenance. ??? Principle Card

### Loose Coupling:

A cornerstone of Microservices is the concept of loose coupling between services. Each microservice operates independently, communicating with others through well-defined APIs. This fosters agility, allowing teams to develop, deploy, and scale services autonomously.

### Autonomous Development and Deployment:

Microservices empower development teams to work independently on individual services, enabling faster release cycles. This autonomy extends to deployment, where each service can be updated and scaled independently without affecting the entire application.

### Scalability and Resilience:

Scalability is inherent in Microservices, as resources can be allocated to specific services based on demand. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Microservices contributes to system resilience, ensuring that a failure in one service does not cascade to the entire application.

### Technology Diversity:

Unlike monolithic architectures, Microservices allow for technology diversity within an application. Each microservice can be implemented using the most suitable technology stack, fostering innovation and the use of cutting-edge tools.

## Disadvantages

### Distributed System Complexity:

Microservices introduce the challenge of managing a distributed system. Architects must address issues such as service discovery, load balancing, and inter-service communication to ensure seamless collaboration between services.

### Data Management:

Effective data management becomes critical in Microservices. Architects must consider data consistency, integrity, and choose appropriate data storage solutions for each service, balancing between centralized and decentralized data management.

### Operational Complexity:

The operational complexity of managing multiple services demands robust monitoring, logging, and error-handling mechanisms. Architects must design for observability to ensure quick detection and resolution of issues.

### Organizational Impact:

The transition to Microservices often requires a shift in organizational culture and structure. Cross-functional teams and DevOps practices become essential to support the autonomy of individual service teams.
