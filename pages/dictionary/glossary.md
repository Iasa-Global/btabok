# Glossary

BTABoK glossary is a table containing a set of definitions for terms which are commonly used in the BTABoK. The glossary contains terms which are defined by IASA and terms which IASA use but may be defined by other organisations or persons. The source column in the table identifies the organisation or person the definition originates from.
