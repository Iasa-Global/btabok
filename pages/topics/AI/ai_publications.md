## AI Action Plan

The National Science Foundation published [a notice on 6 Feb, 2025 to the National Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/06/2025-02305/request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan) offering an opportunity for the general public to provide input for future standards and legislation that the current administration will recommend Congress enact. The AI Community met to discuss what areas we can offer feedback and guidance in, resulting in the submission of a response to this notice. The response balanced the need for regulation to protect consumers without stiffling innovation, as well as keeping sustainability goals in the context of ensuring national security.
