#Overview 
* Public Cloud: A public cloud provides shared resources and services to multiple customers or organizations.
* Private Cloud: A private cloud provides exclusive access to resources and services for a single organization or business unit.
* Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, offering greater flexibility and control for users.

Benefits of Cloud Computing include:

• **Scalability**: Cloud computing allows for easy scaling up or down as needed, reducing costs associated with maintaining excess capacity.

• **Flexibility**: Cloud computing enables access to resources and services anywhere, at any time, on any device, without requiring specific hardware configurations.

• **Cost Savings**: Cloud computing reduces capital expenditures and operational expenses by allowing users to pay only for what they use.

Note: These points highlight only a few examples of the many benefits Cloud Computing brings to various industries and applications.
