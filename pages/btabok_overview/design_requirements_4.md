# Please Save Me From Dumb Requirements - Design Part 4

There is a scene in Fight Club where the main actor is sitting in a meeting with his boss and a software vendor. No one remembers the content of the meeting because it is just background. But the boss' favorite color is cornflower blue ('he's wearing his cornflower blue tie again'). The meeting continues with the boss asking the vendor if he can get all the user-interface buttons in, yep, cornflower blue. This is the epitome of useless requirements. Oh we have been trained that 'the business' defines the requirements it needs, but experience tells us there are a LOT of cornflower blue buttons being built with the companies money. 

As an architect in the middle of design, requirements stitch together the outcome of the system with it's purpose. UI design requirements, quality attribute requirements, constraints, business functionality, all the desires and wants that great systems represent. Sometimes they are specific and sometimes they are general, but ultimately they form the basis for what is delivered, configured or designed.

What do we mean by 'requirements'?

## Conclusion

Well I hope this helps in terms of using the BTABoK for referencing architecture decisions. This is one of my most passionate topic areas and should be on the MUST DO list of any architecture practice. We cannot provide value if we don't know how we make decisions!

In a somewhat backwards way, I started with decisions and will be working to a requirements and objectives article next because I want to show the contextual nature of architecture and how changing decisions can change requirements.

You can find all of these canvases in a mocked-up miro board of the Iasa canvases we will be covering in these articles here: [Miro | Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORNRx4s=/?share_link_id=155880042988).

I am looking forward to this Design Series based on the BTABoK. Here is my current thinking on the order they will come in:

~~1.      Dissecting Design – And Introduction - Done~~

~~2.      Options, Options, Options – So Many Choices - Done~~

~~3.      Decision Rights Rule the World – Why Agile Architecture is so Hard~~

~~4.      From Cornflower Blue Buttons to Architecturally Significant Requirements~~

5.      Views and *BEYOND* – Thinking, Facilitating, and Communicating

6.      I Like Patterns – Patterns, Reference Models, and Conformance

7.      Assessments, Tests, and Chasing Perfection – How Governance and Assessment are Different
