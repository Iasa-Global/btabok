# BTABoK Tenets

The BTABoK tenets are the core principles and foundational beliefs that underpin and guide the Business Technology Body of Knowledge. They serve as the blueprint for its structure and evolution, providing a stable foundation upon which new knowledge and practices are built.

## Technology Neutral

The BTABoK relevance remains consistent regardless of the specific technology platforms, products, or vendors involved. By focusing on foundational principles rather than transient tools, the BTABoK ensures that architectural approaches remain adaptable, sustainable, and aligned with strategic business goals over time.


## Open And Accessable

The BTABoK is openly accessible to all architects, providing a shared resource that supports both learning and professional practice. It encourages active participation—not only in applying its guidance but also in shaping its ongoing development. Whether you're a seasoned enterprise architect or just starting out in the field, you're invited to use, and contribute to this evolving body of knowledge, ensuring it remains practical, relevant, and community-driven.

## Scalable

The BTABoK  is scalable and adaptable, making it relevant for organizations of all sizes—from small startups to large global enterprises. Its principles and practices are flexible enough to address the unique challenges of a small team while also supporting the complexity and scale of multinational corporations. This versatility ensures that architects can apply the knowledge effectively, regardless of the organization's size, structure, or industry.

## Reflects Industry Needs

The BTABoK remains highly relevant because it is grounded in the real-world needs and priorities of modern industries. As organizations evolve in response to market demands, technological advancements, and operational challenges, the BTABoK  evolves alongside them. This ensures it stays aligned with current business realities, enabling architects to deliver value-driven solutions that are both practical and forward-looking.

## Context Aware

The BTABoK supports multiple contexts and provides guidance aligned with these different contexts. This includes system type, industry, size, risk and business criticality.

## Continuous Leaning and Adaption

Architecture is a discipline of perpetual learning. The BTABok should foster a culture of retrospection, share learnings from success and failure, and stay current with evolving practices and technologies.

## Tried And Tested
The knowledge, methods and tools in the BTABoK are tried and tested in the real world practice of architecture.

## By Architects For Architects
The BTABoK is created and maintained based on the contribution of architects sharing their experience to further the development of architects at all levels of seniority.

## Evolution Over Revolution
Establishing and validating working practices means that knowledge and methods have to stand the test of time. Technology and archtiecture trends come and go. The BTABoK is evolves and changes according to practices which have gained acceptance in the archtiecture profession.
