## Accreditation Method for the BTABOK Partnership Program

### Introduction

The Business Technology Architecture Body of Knowledge (BTABOK) from Iasa is a comprehensive framework for architecture and business technology strategy, providing organizations with the guidelines, practices, and standards necessary for achieving significant and sustainable maturity. Our accredited partnership program aims to recognize and endorse services firms that excel in applying BTABOK principles and methodologies. This document outlines the accreditation method for our program, including guidance for achieving accreditation and the minimum requirements for Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels.

### Accreditation Process

#### 1. Application and Initial Assessment

Firms interested in accreditation must submit an application that includes:

- A detailed description of their services and how they align with BTABOK principles.
- Case studies or project examples demonstrating the application of BTABOK methodologies.
- Qualifications and experience of their consultants and staff.

The initial assessment will involve a review of the submitted materials by the accreditation team to ensure they meet the basic eligibility criteria.

#### 2. Documentation Review

The documentation review will focus on the firm's:

- Adoption and integration of BTABOK practices in their service offerings.
- Training and development programs related to BTABOK for their employees.
  - Number and type of architects through the career path levels up to Chief Architect
- Contribution and thought leadership from the firms employees. 
  - BTABoK contributions and other Iasa locations
  - Board certification leadership
- Quality assurance processes and continuous improvement initiatives.

This stage ensures that the firm has robust documentation and processes that align with BTABOK standards.

#### 3. On-Site/Company Evaluation

- Interviews with key personnel.
- Observation of projects and practices.
- Review of client feedback and outcomes.

#### 4. Accreditation Decision
