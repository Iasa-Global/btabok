Like any other strategy out there, it should be written and capitalized SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely) as the main approach.

On the other hand, innovation is the activity or process of introducing new or improved things such as an idea, concept or method. Therefore, technology innovation is the activity or process which new or improved technologies are developed and introduced.

On top of that, Architect might want to capitalize his/her visioning skill of technology innovation so later on he/she could articulate, accommodate and adopt it into his current and future architecture as well as provide technology innovation for business objectives.

# Proven Practices

**Describe why an architect should be involved in this skill at a corporate level**

The Architect is often requested by the management and executives particularly CIO, technology and business top management to give input and feedback on the development, improvement and enhancement of technology strategy plan in which IT and business alignment to meet organizational goals and IT contribution to improve organizational performance should be reflected in the plan.

With Architect involvement, the organization could expect a great number of advantages and benefits such as the success of IT to deliver value, good understanding of IT by business executives, clear vision with respect to IT, same worldviews of business executives and technology specialists, proper shared vision in relation to IT.

Through the Architect vision on technology innovation, he/she might want to identify, assess, analyze and in the end decide which emerging technology suitable for the organization to deploy and derive the benefits of at its most including the logical analysis to manage the impact of architectural changes.

**Primary push back and/or challenges for architects**

As an Architect it is challenging to balance the concerns between technology strategy, technology innovation and the concerns of architecture. We, as an Architect, always want to develop the best possible architecture but at the same time we may be constrained by the time, budget, resources, organization policies, laws, regulations, architectural concerns, process, tool, decision and framework whenever trying to fulfill requirements of the technology strategy plan and when trying to accommodate evolving technologies out there into our organization.

Another important push back to consider at is the Architect ability to convince and influence the business to adopt and widespread technology both strategy and innovation aspects. In particular when there is a cost associated with it and whenever IT is often perceived and seen as a Cost Center.

Moreover, Architects do not architect the business. They provide the technology strategy underpinnings to any successful business capability.

**How would a stakeholder engage an architect for assistance utilizing this skill?**

Stakeholders can engage with the Architect at any stage in technology strategy plan from the development, improvement, enhancement and execution. Even in management review, when executives and top management are keen to explore the opportunity to adopt emerging, proven technologies to boost their organization performance or enhance their competitiveness in the industry.

As an Architect, we are expected to be able to define a business objective, match technology to the business objectives of a project, identify a technology strategy that positively affects the entire organization, and lead the executive sponsors and business managers in defining IT strategy.
