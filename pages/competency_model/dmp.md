# Description

A software-intensive system is any system where software contributes essential influences to the design, construction, deployment, and evolution of the system as a whole. Despite significant efforts to improve engineering practices and technologies, software-intensive systems continue to present formidable risks and difficulties in their design, construction, deployment, and evolution.

There is a general consensus on the importance of the architectural level of systems design, consisting of early decision making about overall design structure, goals, requirements, and development strategies. The architecture has different meaning for different stakeholders:

*   The specification of the system to be implemented (blueprint)
*   A medium of communication for achieving common understanding (a language)
*   A rationale for the choices about the system to be implemented
*   A documentation for current and future generations of users and developers of the acceptable practices (a narrative).

This multiplicity of views imply a need to describe the architecture from multiple complementary perspectives.

Broadly speaking the diverse software architecture development methods can be classified as:

*   Artifact driven methods: are defined in terms of the artifacts to be produced and the notations employed in their elaboration. Examples of this approach are the object oriented methods (such as OAD and OMT) with their emphasis on structural description of the system.
*   Use case driven methods: use the description of use cases as the primary artifact. Rational Unified Process and test (or compliance) driven processes exemplify this approach. Attribute driven methods use the quality attributes as the main driver for selecting one architectural option over others.
*   Domain driven methods: use concepts from the domain to drive the architecture definition. Domain analysis-based and product line-oriented methods like BAPO/CAFCR follow this approach.

# Overview

Regardless of the main focus of the method (artifacts, use cases, attributes, or domain), the architectural design process includes the following aspects

1.  Analysis of architecture requirements, identifying concerns, and providing context for decision making through the process
2.  Documentation of the desirable characteristics and supporting principles of the system and its evolution, to facilitate communicating them with the system’s stakeholders
3.  Evaluation and comparison of architecture alternatives in a consistent manner
4.  Verification of compliance of the actual system implementation with its architectural description
5.  Management of the evolution of the architecture.

# Proven Practices

*   Establish common design methods and processes across the organization, adapting them to the possibly different sub-organizations characteristic of large corporations. Traditional approaches tend to impose similar process to diverse teams regardless their sizes, and the characteristics of the system to be developed (e.g. internally versus externally developed systems). On the other extreme, so called “agile” methods leave to the teams the decision of what and how document architecture, if architecture was developed at all. More recently the “disciplined agile” approach looks for a middle ground balancing need for rigor with the need for agility.
*   Implement policies for ensuring the management of the software architecture throughout its full life cycle, including the periodic re-assessment of system goals and constraints and the evaluation of the architecture compliance, as well as the procedures to manage deviations.

### **Architecture requirement analysis**

The Architecture requirement analysis is the process by which system’s goals and expected quality attributes are identified. Such requirements must be directly linked to business and mission goals, and explicitly involve system stakeholders.

One of the most important steps in analysis is the definition of the design context: where the final delivered system will fit into the current operational environment. The identification of stakeholders, system goals, and of scenarios and use cases all depend on how the boundaries are chosen.

Requirement elicitation can be done using diverse techniques such as the use of questionnaires and surveys, interviews, and analysis of existing documentation. Group elicitation techniques can be used to foster stakeholder buy-in and exploit team dynamics to elicit a richer understanding of needs and promote agreement among diverse stakeholders. Such techniques include brainstorming, focus groups, and consensus-building workshops. More formal methods also exist, which are based on a detailed model of the type of information to be gathered, such as quality attributes and their definition in terms of quality metrics.

### **Architecture synthesis**

This activity is the core of the architecture development process. It proposes solutions to the various concerns in terms of system organization patterns and development principles.

The description of the solution should be made from diverse viewpoints which reflect different concerns of the systems such as the mapping to problem domain and functional requirements, organization of development artifacts, runtime components and their behaviors, and mapping to the deployment infrastructure, among others. In order to be useful documented speciﬁcations have to be both suﬃciently detailed for analysis and adequately abstract for understanding.

It is desirable that the design process adopts a well defined architecture style, encapsulating important decisions about the architectural elements and emphasizes important constraints on the elements and their relationships.

The process is generally backed by a reference architecture that entails a set of best practices for the domain on which the system must operate. In certain industries and technology domains such reference architecture has been formalized. Some examples are the  [eTOM framework](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/services/high-availability/white_paper_c11-541448.html) for the telecommunications industry, and the [IOT-A reference architecture](http://www.iot-a.eu/arm/d1.3/at_download/file) for the Internet of Things domain.

### **Analysis of alternative architectures**

The purpose of the analysis of a software system’s architecture is to verify that the quality requirements have been addressed in the design and identify to potential risks. Broadly speaking the evaluation methods can be classified as software metrics-based, scenario-based, and attribute model-based. The software metrics methods use module coupling and cohesion notions to identify potential quality issues. Methods based on scenarios focus on spotting requirement conflicts or incomplete design specification from a particular stakeholder’s perspective. Attribute model-based architecture evaluation methods focus on evaluating quality metrics. The evaluation techniques can be narratives, checklists, formal methods, simulation, or prototyping.

### **Architecture compliance assessment**

A recurrent problem faced by software architects is to certify that a system is implemented according to its planned architecture. During the implementation and evolution of a system, it is common to observe deviations from the defined architecture, even in the first release, due to unawareness by developers, conflicting requirements, late changes in requirements, technical difficulties, and deadline or budget pressures. Such deviations usually accumulate with time, leading to the phenomena known as architectural erosion.

Architecture compliance is a measure to which degree the implemented architecture in the source code conforms to the planned architecture. For assessing the compliance, a model of the actual system must be created and compared to the architecture model, in order to identify violations such as unintended dependencies.

Alternatively, deviations from the intended architecture can be prevented by enforcing it through prescribed design patterns that offer well-established solutions to recurring design problems, following the architecture’s constraints, introducing frameworks whose architecture is aligned with the intended architecture, or using tools that generate architecture-compliant code.

### **Architecture evolution management**

A software system’s ability to easily accommodate future changes in business requirements, organizational context, and technology. It is a fundamental characteristic for increasing economic value of software and minimize technological risk in an organization. For long-lived systems, there is a need to address evolvability explicitly during the entire software lifecycle in order to prolong the productive lifetime of software systems.
