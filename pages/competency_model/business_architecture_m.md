## Building Business Architects

The business architect is a leader of the overall practice with deep relationships in line of business leadership, operations, strategy, finance and others. They must navigate the world of business activities to extract and connect digital innovation and outcomes to real business value. Thus it is necessary to master both the concepts and the tools of a business and to master the connection with the rest of the architecture practice. 

The following competency areas are used to measure a business architect's career journey. The competency model for business architects is based on the [5 pillars](../engagement_model/competency.md) of architecture. It is necessary to understand each of the core competency areas in addition to business architecture. Each competency can be developed from foundation to distinguished ([career path levels](../engagement_model/career.md)).
