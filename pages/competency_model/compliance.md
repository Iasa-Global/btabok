# Description

Compliance denotes a (generally) mandatory conformance to specified rules framed by institutions such as businesses, governments, accredited standards bodies and industry groups. From a technology perspective, compliance is applicable to technology enabled business processes and the underlying technology itself.

The most important use of compliance is as a risk mitigation technique where non-conformance can result in serious human, environmental, societal or economic loss. Losses from non-compliance can have impact widespread impact to a business or industry, in some cases globally. Compliance has a positive implication where adherence signifies high quality of a business and its products. Compliance is generally governed through risk management, quality controls and audits and as such, perceived as a "cost of doing business".

# Overview

Architects play an important role in advising business on meeting compliance needs through technology as well as making the right investments to ensure a "business compliant" architecture. Compliance knowledge denotes an understanding and mitigation of regulatory impacts to the organization and the design/solution being deployed, including audits, certifications, licensing, and general industry regulation types. The IT architect is expected to be "compliance aware" in business and technology dimensions and have the ability to articulate the regulatory requirements that drive design elements, including regulation, governance, legal and other binding corporate agreements.

For business process compliance, architects focus on technology enablement to better meet compliance requirements such as information capture, measurement and reporting needs for internal and external stakeholders e.g. reporting to government regulatory agencies. Conversely, they also have to ensure that technology enablement does not compromise any compliance requirements e.g. protection of personal and financial information. IT architects should work with business architects and business SMEs to identify compliance needs related to architecture layers such as user interface, information access, storage and reporting. Technology compliance means that the underlying technology adheres to norms for inter-operability and quality requirements e.g. manufacturing processes and interfaces between software and hardware products. Information and infrastructure compliance are two primary facets of technology that are governed under regulatory and legal laws. Information and infrastructure architects should play a key role to ensure compliance needs are identified and implemented as a critical use case of a technology solution.

As compliance is an on-going activity and perceived as cost of doing business, architects should also try to add value by scanning technology trends that will facilitate compliance e.g. leveraging self-aware or closed loop feedback systems, or implementing compliance monitoring and reporting solutions.

A key challenge for architects is to ensure that all facets of compliance are implemented and working as planned in the technology portfolio. Another challenge is lack of awareness of the risks introduced by non-compliant technology solutions. Compliance may get compromised due to improper planning or awareness and occasionally, by implicit behaviors allowing non-compliance (as a cost of doing business). Architects should be well aware of threats and consequences of non-compliance and should advocate uses of governance frameworks such as COBIT as well as audits which allow explicit management of technology compliance in an organization.

# Best Practices


-   Addressing compliance needs in the Enterprise Architecture and setting up compliance standards.
-   Compliance verification as part of architecture review process.
-   Usage of industry recognized standards and frameworks in architecture e.g. ISO.
-   Auditing for compliance internally and by third party.
-   Using enterprise governance frameworks as COBIT.
-   Persistently making compliance a business driven activity.
-   Business sponsorship and investments for compliance.

# Sub-Capabilities

## Compliance Review

Compliance Review is an independent assessment of the conformity of any activity, process, deliverable, product or service to the criteria of specified standards, such as ISO 27001, local standards, best practice, or other documented requirements. Compliance review is generally a periodic activity which is conducted by internal independent audit functions and third parties. Compliance review is initiated via a baseline and certification process conducted by an accredited and independent third party, with on-going audits and reviews to verify continued compliance.
