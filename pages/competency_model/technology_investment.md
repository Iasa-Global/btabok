# Description 

Technology investment includes the motivation for and management of investments in technology. The technology investment portfolio is part of a larger portfolio of investments in business changes, and is driven by the need to improve one or more performance measures of the business as a whole based on a cascade of required changes identified by tools such as a Balanced Scorecard and Strategy Map. Technology investment includes methods and processes for aligning technology investments to business changes, determining the value contribution of a technology investment, and the overall management of an investment portfolio.

# Overview

Money spent on information technology (IT) is either expense (money spent to operate and maintain the existing IT environment) or investment (money spent to change the IT environment to improve some performance measure for the business. This capability focuses on investments. The starting point is the motivation for investing in IT, which always starts with the need to improve one or more performance measures of the business as a whole. The business invests in business change, usually including process and/or organization changes, which may require investment in IT. Thus, an IT investment is always a component of some larger investment in business change. The specific investments required by the business can be identified using a planning tool such as the Balanced Scorecard or Strategy Map.

The set of IT projects can be viewed and managed as a set of IT investments. Taking this view will always ensure that IT projects are aligned with the needs of the business. Projects are prioritized in relation to their relative contribution to the overall investment in business change, including cross-project dependencies. Thus, it is no longer strictly necessary for every IT project to have a positive return on investment, so long as the larger business change has a positive effect on the performance of the business. This is a major change in how IT investments are viewed and managed.

This capability covers the ability to identify potential investments in IT and on methods to manage the IT investment portfolio as part of a larger business investment portfolio.

The business architect is uniquely positioned to evaluate the overall business change and determine the IT investments necessary to support it. Further, the function of business architecture is responsible for managing the overall investment portfolio, including investments in IT. While business architects do not own the investment portfolio, they own the processes used to select, value, and manage the investments that go into the portfolio. This includes participation in the budgeting process since the need for capital investment is driven by necessary changes to the business, not just investments in IT.

As a practical matter, it often falls to the business and enterprise architects to review projects as they are proposed for addition to the portfolio. In many companies, the results of this process is a set of wish list items for either business or IT leaders, and have little relationship with the investment needs of the business. With this progressive view of technology investment, project proposals are graded and ranked according to their contribution to business change goals as determined by the business change investment portfolio. In addition, projects that are required to maintain the current state of operation should also be included. Managing this pipeline in this way can be controversial, requiring that an architect draw on all of their stakeholder management skills.

# Proven Practices

-   Articulate and demonstrate why an investment management approach to selecting business change and technology projects is superior to typical methods that simply prioritize a wish list
-   Use investment management skills and practices to optimize an overall investment portfolio
-   Ensure that selected business change and technology projects reflect the investments necessary to move the business towards a state in which it is capable of achieving its strategic goals
-   Ensure that risks are identified, analyzed, and mitigated to minimize the potential disruption to the business

# Sub-Capabilities

## Technology Support of Business Process

A business process, process step, or activity can be manual, supported by technology, or fully automated. The business architect, in consultation with the technical architects, must determine the optimum level of technology support for each process step or activity given the business environment, competitive priorities, and the capabilities of the IT organization.

## Project Selection

A portfolio of business change investments consists of both business change (e.g. process improvement, training, or reorganization) and technology projects. Managing both as a single portfolio ensures that investments in technology remain aligned with investments in business changes. The goal of project selection is to ensure that the optimum mix of projects are funded and implemented to move the company towards the state necessary to achieve its strategic goals.

## Managing Investment Risk

Like any investment portfolio, there is risk to be managed. In addition to external risk due to business condition changes and such, there is the execution risk -- the ability or inability of a company to actually implement the changes required. Using skills from the Risk Management capability, business and enterprise architects continually identify, assess, and mitigate both kinds of risk. One of the major tools available to business and enterprise architects for identifying and analyzing risks is scenario-based planning.
