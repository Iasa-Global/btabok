# Description

The terms Leadership and Management are often used together however they are not the same thing. There are great leaders and there are great managers but rarely do you find a person that is great at both. A leader is forward focused, about vision and goals, about where you want to go. A leader inspires others to want to follow along the path and contribute to the achievement of that vision. Management however is much more detail oriented and disciplined. A great manager can juggle many things at once and still keep projects on track. A manager will facilitate the attainment of the goals and\or vision of the leader. It is like the difference between an architect and a project manager. The architect has a clear vision of what the building should look like and knows exactly how it should be built but when it comes to actually building the structure a project manager is needed to ensure that the details of the vision are implemented. As an architect our job is not to do all the work but to have the overall blueprint of how it should look and to bring in the appropriate project managers and subject matter experts to facilitate the creation of that vision. Today's architects must have strong leadership skills and also good management skills to facilitate the success of their projects.

# Overview

**Why does an architect need this skill?**

The architect must be able to clearly define the vision---the "to be" state---so that each and every member of the team understands what is to be accomplished.

**Common tasks involved in this skill?**

A clearly defined vision includes the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the project.

Who needs this project completed? Who is responsible for this project?

What is the project? What is the end state? What will success look like?

When will the project be started? When should it be completed?

Where will the project be utilized?

Why is the project important?

How will the project be completed? How is the project funded? How does this project affect other projects?

**What is their ownership in this skill?**

The architect is responsible for working with the project sponsors and the management team to understand and document the project. Once the documentation is complete the architect is responsible for clearly communication the project and then monitoring the progress of the project.

**Name an example of how an architect would use this in daily activities?**

The architect must be able to envision the end state and also communicate the desired end state. If the architect envisions a people moving system without clearly articulating all of the requirements of the people moving system then the architect may end up with a horse and buggy when they really envisioned and needed a high speed rail.

# Proven Practices

**Describe why an architect should be involved in this skill at a corporate level**

The architect is uniquely qualified to understand the organizations strategic goals and then design, document, and articulate that vision into quantifiable actions. Without this ability the chances of the organizations priorities and goals being accomplished are minimal.

**Primary push back and/or challenges for architects**

The architect will face challenges on several fronts. The existing team may push back because they know how to build widget X because they have been doing it for years. The senior management team may push back because they do not have the time for an architect to define\gather all the requirements and then document the end state.

**How would a stakeholder engage an architect for assistance utilizing this skill?**

The stakeholder may have a vision for project X but not have the capacity or training to adequately design the solution. The architect would have the capability to design the solution and should have the institutional knowledge to understand how the project will fit within the rest of the corporate portfolio.
