# Description 

Demonstrated management/mitigation of issues relative to manageability, maintainability, supportability, extensibility, and flexibility.Â Demonstrated competence in implementation techniques.

Expectations
- Can describe how they manage supporting, detracting pairs of quality attributes to determine impact of tradeoffs

| Configuration Management | Field of IT management that focuses on establishing and maintaining consistency of a system's or product's performance and its functional and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life. |
| Operations Change Management | Raising and recording of changes, assessing the impact, cost, benefit and risk of proposed changes, developing business justification and obtaining approval, managing and coordinating change implementation, monitoring and reporting on implementation, reviewing and closing change requests. |
