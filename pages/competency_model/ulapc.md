# Description

Usage-related quality attributes is the demonstrated understanding of usability and human factor fundamentals, with the ability to describe related internationalization strategies and current issues as well as demonstrated competence in implementation techniques.

# Overview

##  Internationalization and Localization

Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

##  Usability Evaluation and Impact

Formal assessment of the usability (including health and safety, and accessibility) of new or existing products or services (including prototypes). Methods include user trials, expert review, survey, and analysis.

##  Systems Ergonomics

The iterative development of the allocation of function, user interaction and job design. The optimization of accessibility and usability, based on user requirements, the context of use, relevant ergonomics knowledge and feedback from evaluations of prototypes.

##  Usage-Related Quality Attributes

Usage affects every aspect of your success:

-   In value recognition
-   In user involvement
-   In future engagements

Usability should be evaluated based on value metrics:

-   Productivity
-   Time to complete task
-   Error rates and impact
-   Perception
    -   Usage patterns
    -   Value recognition

***Warning:** Too much focus on usability 'can' be a waste---make sure you truly understand the value.*

##  Cost of Not Knowing

-   Lack of recognition of solution value
-   Productivity losses
-   Ineffective solution regardless of functionality

##  Skills Analysis

-   I have reviewed the concepts in usage attributes.
-   I have studied usage attributes in detail.
-   I regularly manage usage attributes on projects.
-   I lead and mentor others on usage attributes in our company.

# Concepts

##  Usability

If a solution is delivered but never used, it isn't providing value, and you will never know if it is being used or how effectively if you don't design an approach to measuring usage into your design. Although end users don't always know what they need or what is possible, they are more comfortable with small changes in the solutions you provide than wholesale change.

## Localization

As an architect, you should understand what elements of a solution change to support localization.

## Accessibility

One of the most common oversights in accessibility is not considering people who are colorblind in designing your solution. Over the last two decades, innovative solutions have been introduced to help with accessibility concerns. Consider researching current solutions.
