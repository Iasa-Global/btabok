# Description

Financial methods encompass many topics, including:

-   Standard financial statement analysis
-   Time-Driven Activity Based Costing (TDABC)
-   Capital vs. Operational Expense
-   Cost vs. Investment
-   Debt Financing vs. Working Capital
-   Creation, collection, and reporting of structural performance measures (see note) for business services, process, and capabilities

Note: Structural performance measures can be key performance indicators, but are not the same thing. Structural performance measures assess the potential to perform, not actual performance. Actual performance is a combination of potential and the degree to which a structure Is used, or as Chris Potts puts It, exploited. A high potential structure can produce no results if it is not exploited.

# Overview

Everything that happens in an enterprise has a financial impact. Sometimes, the impact directly affects one or more of the key performance measures for the enterprise. Other times, the impact is not so direct, and can in fact be quite circuitous; it can be very difficult to quantify some costs or benefits. Managers of business units, processes, and capabilities often cannot directly affect important financial measures, instead relying on proxies they do control. The business architect is uniquely situated to understand the relationship between these proxies and specific key financial measures. This provides the business architect the opportunity to coach business unit leaders and process owners on the best ways to change their unit or process's performance in order to achieve the desired financial outcomes.

The key tool of the business architect for assessing the current state of a business or process is a set of structural performance measures that provide a picture of the performance potential of a business unit, process, or capability. The business architect has many other tools at their disposal to understand and model the many ways that the structural performance of a business unit, service, process, or capability are linked to financial outcomes.

Starting with basic financial statement analysis that provides most of the financial performance measures currently in use, the business architect can use time-driven activity based costing to quickly and easily determine the capacity cost and capacity required for a business unit, organization, or process. This information will help determine where bottlenecks are currently and will likely arise as investments are made to improve processes or capabilities.

Financial methods include an understanding of the differences between and uses of:

-   Capital and operational expenses (CapEx and OpEx)
-   Costs to operate an operating model and investments to change the operating model
-   Financing a project with debt and financing it with working capital

In some cases, the appropriate measure to use can be hard to measure. In these cases, the business architect can draw on several methods to determine measures that are close enough to what is required to serve as a proxy.

## Financial Statement Analysis

The basic financial skill of being able to analyze a set of financial statements is critical to understanding the motivation and current health of the business.

## Financial Effects of Investment

All change initiatives have at their root improvements in financial performance, but it is nearly impossible to change financial performance directly. There is a linkage and degree of influence between changes the business can implement directly and the desired changes in financial performance. Different measures of performance are influenced by different kinds of changes, and the business architect needs to understand how the potential changes the business can make directly are linked to those measures of financial performance. This is "understanding the plumbing" of the business and can help the business architect guide senior leaders into investing in the changes that have the most potential to impact the targeted financial measures.

## Time-Driven Activity Based Costing

Time-driven activity based costing (TDABC) is a powerful, easy-to-use, method to determine the basic cost structure of a process, an organization, business unit, or entire company. By collecting a few answers to simple questions and performing some quick calculations, a business architect can determine whether the process or business unit is near capacity, what that capacity costs to provide, the resources consumed by each activity, and the potential budget given projected volumes of business activity.

## Measurement of Non-Financial Costs and Benefits

It can be difficult at times to determine the financial costs and benefits a potential investment might have. Not all structural performance measures are financial. Business leaders may not understand how best to measure the performance of their business units. There are several methods for measuring things that are otherwise hard to measure. Business architects need to be subject matter experts in how to measure the performance of the business using financial and other measures
