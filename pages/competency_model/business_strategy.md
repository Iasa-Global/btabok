# Description 

There are many definitions for Business Strategy proposed by multitudes of authors. The definition can be aggregated as either separately or in combination. Strategy is a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. According to Porter there are three principles  underlying strategy: creating a "unique and valuable [market] position", making trade-offs by choosing "what not to do", and creating fit  by aligning company activities with one another to support the chosen strategy(1). Strategy can also be seen as a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments and actions that respond to high stakes challenge (2). Business is defined as an organization involved in the trade of goods, services or both to consumers (3). Business Strategy can be expressed in the form of Strategic Management Frameworks (**Figure 1**) or the strategy map (**Figure 2**).

# Overview

Business strategy is pertinent to the architect as it is the foundation for his value delivery to the organization. The capability to review the business strategy is important for the architect to contribute in terms of technology and architectural aspects during  the lifecycle of business strategy management. The architect has many roles to carry out during the Business Strategy management and lifecycle. The main role is to be the technology strategist and contribute on how technology can be leveraged to achieve the outcomes for the business strategy (6).

# Proven Practices

The architects role can be segregated according to the phases of the Management of the business strategy (7). During the development phase, to be an active part of the team developing the business strategy, contributing on the architectural and technology aspects during the strategic analysis and formulation of the business strategy and maintaining traceability to the mission vision and value.

During the translation of strategy, contributing to the definition of strategic objectives and themes, selection of measures and target; and the strategic initiatives leveraging on technology to increase value of the business outcome.During the planning for operations phase contributing to improvement of key processes, development of operations plan, planning for resource capacity and preparing the budget.

During the execution of the initiatives, to identify and take ownership of technology related execution, facilitating and enabling the business owners in executing the processes and initiatives. During the monitoring and learning phase, to take an active part in the strategic an operational review. During the testing and adaptation of the strategy, taking part in the profitability analysis, strategic correlation analysis and examination of emerging strategies.

The capability to apply the architecture principles to the business strategy during the lifecycle management is important to deliver value to the organization. The role of the architect is to contribute and add value to the business outcome and strategy execution using established frameworks, diagrams and metrics. The frameworks are used to form the foundation for the strategic execution and form the basis for communication to relevant stakeholders and subject matter experts. The main use of architectural artifacts are to communicate complicated abstractions in the form of diagrams and metrics to subject matter experts. Diagrams are used to communicate complicated and abstract concepts in a concise visual manner to foster understanding of the concept while maintaining the real-world complexity. Metrics are used to show the complicated relationships between attributes and measures to the relevant stakeholders(8).

The most important role the architect have is to construct a traceability matrix from technology investments to the business outcomes stipulated in the business strategy to deliver value of the investments to the organization. The traceability must include the relationship of  the business to IT strategy and the linkages of the information technology to the  business infrastructure and processes (please refer **Figure 3**). One example is the technology information alignment perspective where the Business Strategy is the driver, the role of top management as a technology visionary, the Information System management serve as the technology architect and the performance criteria is technology leadership (9).
