# Description 

This capability is being depreciated in version 2.0 due to the following rationale:

-   Overlaps too much with Desing: Patterns and Styles. The point of the 5 pillars are shared capabilities across specializations.
-   It is listed in Software Architecture but not other specializations. The other specializations have their own patterns, therefore either all specializations should list them or none.

It will not be included on certifications which are mapped to version 3.0 of the BTABoK.
