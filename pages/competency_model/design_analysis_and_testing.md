# Description

Architecture analysis techniques and related tools allow an IT architect to evaluate a design relative to alternatives, describe the structure and state of a design, and analyze the design's dynamic behavior in response to external events. They can then test a design as an artifact for completeness, correctness, efficiency, and a number of other criteria.

Highest priority techniques such as selected ATAM techniques, failure analysis, optimization, prototyping, simulation, scaled modeling, and various forms of walk-throughs and design reviews can be used to perform analysis and testing.

## Expectations

-   Has participated in design analysis
-   Has identified and mitigated poor design early
-   Validates architecture that solves the intended business problem

| **Element** | **Description** |
| Pattern Analysis | The ability to discover and quantify patterns in the design, validate the adequate application of the pattern and analyze the probable outcomes of using (or not using) the pattern. |
| Identification and Remediation of Poor Design | Analysis techniques and related tools that allow an architect to evaluate and qualify design choices relative to alternatives. |
| Validation of Design Elements | The process of checking that a solution meets stated requirements and specifications and that the design elements fulfill the intended purpose. |
