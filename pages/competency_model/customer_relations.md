# Description

The Architect demonstrates an understanding of the psychological dynamics of customer management and discusses business imperatives, modern techniques and tools for relationship management, industry engagement, contractual agreements, transparency and accountability, and related issues. Managing high-risk scenarios is also a demonstrated competence of the role.

## The psychological dynamics of customer management


Five personality dynamics prevail in relatively consistent but unequal *proportions*.  These recur sequentially for a given work process:

1.  Explore
    1.  Understand the complete situation, see relationships, and develop creative solutions.
2.  Excite
    1.  Invest in exciting others about the idea. Dissolve silos and develop internal support. Build a team.
3.  Examine
    1.  Develop an implementation plan using data. Create schedules, budgets, timetables, clear roles and rules, etc.  Predict problems.  Find faults.
4.  Execute
    1.  Aggressively implement the plan. Hold people accountable.  Measure performance.    Strive for completion.
5.  Evaluate
    1.  Evaluate the preceding four Dynamics by examining external success (e.g., cost, time, quality, profit) and internal satisfaction (engagement, absence of stress). Adapt the process to increase success and satisfaction going forward.

It's important to note that each personality dynamic is of equal *value* and every personality dynamic has an unbounded capacity for growth. However, the way in which the members of each personality dynamic function is completely different.

When there is a lack of recognition of these differences in people, there is often misunderstanding, conflict, and an inability to make use of individual and group potential, whether in the classroom, in the work-place, or in the home.

A healthy relationship between the professional and client is one that includes intense interactions followed by respectful distancing, mutually high demands for quality, complementary but not overlapping visions, and the ability to engage in productive conflict.  The lone genius architect, or any individual professional, is a myth.  Excellence comes from an evolving chemistry among the principal participants.

## Business imperatives

The new and sustainable competitive edge resides in improving both staff connectivity (internal relations) and market connectivity (improved win ratio).  The most valuable currency we have is the emotional capital of relationships.  Human beings make decisions first for emotional reasons, second for rational reasons.  The effective architect is present, listens and expects to be surprised, preferring perspectives over being right.  Successful relationships are anchored by character and competence: trust earned through sincerely caring about others and being open.  Without it three problems occur: non-inclusion, the illusion of inclusion and the loudest get heard.

Customers want a consistent, connected, personalized, and efficient experience throughout all phases of the customer lifecycle delivered seamlessly across all touch points. Exceptional Customer Experience (CX) drives revenue and creates loyalty, advocacy, and repeat business. The prevalence of social media today means that customer satisfaction may not only impact repeat business from that person, but frequently also impacts new or repeat business from their social media circle. Therefore, CX is more important than ever.

Top technology priorities for business leaders all center on improving CX in order to retain, serve, upsell to existing clients and lure new clients away from the competition.  Business process and EA practices that focus on blending Design and System Thinking techniques develops a digital enterprise/business that is essential to success.

## Modern techniques

There is a gap in the general approach to problem solving between design agencies and enterprise architects.  The former use Design Thinking practices, such as empathy and prototyping, while enterprise architects use deductive reasoning and quantitative analysis, or Systems Thinking.

CX, EA, BP -- operate tightly

-   CX: Delight Customers
    -   New digital channels
    -   Engagement
-   EA: Embrace volatility
    -   New acquisitions and markets
    -   Build architectures that can sustain bringing on new channels
-   BP: Test and learn loop
    -   Continuous Improvement, focus on building a process to further enhance

Balance the 3 by using design thinking instead of system thinking

Design Thinking

-   A collection of practices that helps teams better identify with customer experiences, and **shift** from logical problem solving to creative experimentation.

| **System Thinking Practices** | **Design Thinking Practices** |
| Holistic | Specific |
| Linkages | Context |
| Logic | Empathy |
| Deductive | Abductive |

Empathy

-   Not with the tech or processes, it's about discovering information about the company by interacting with the employees
-   Drive empathy using personas of employees and/or customers
    -   It's important to imagine new personas with unique attributes
    -   Process team and Architects will take ownership of the persona and develop a solution that satisfies the personas around abductive experimentation practice

Don't abandon System Thinking completely.  Merge Design and System thinking

System thinking correlated with Design thinking

| **System Thinking Practices** | **Design Thinking Practices** |
| Process models | Journey maps |
| Capability maps | Personas |
| Target Operation Models | Storytelling |

Design Thinking

-   Collaborative
    -   Working with people who share similar and dissimilar experiences to generate richer work.
-   Abductive
    -   Starts from a set of accepted facts and works back to their most likely explanation
-   Experimental
    -   Build prototypes. Pose hypotheses. Test.    All to manage risk.
-   Personal
    -   Realize each problem -- and the people there to solve it -- has a unique context.
-   Integrative
    -   Seeing the whole system and its many connections.

Customer journey map using a persona (highlighting customer's key goals and pet peeves) to walk CX through process milestones

-   Goals
    -   Initial research and expectation setting
    -   Deeper research and consideration
    -   Commitment moment
-   Actions
-   Experience

Translate internal business value (inside out) to customer's perception of business value (outside in)

| **Inside Out (Efficiency, Productivity, Quality)** | **Outside In (Convenience, Engagement, Advocacy)** |
| Business Process Improvement | Customer Experience Improvement |
| Focus on efficiency | Focus on value creation |
| The model and the process is the subject | The customer and their life is the subject |
| The business identifies the problem | The customer identifies the problem |
| Respond to customer feedback | Respond to latent and anticipated customer needs |
| Design with business teams | Design with customers |
| Design operating principles | Design service principles |
| Define benchmarks and metrics | Determine what customers truly value |
| Define, measure, analyze, improve, control, replicate | Discover, define, develop, deliver |

Metrics

| **Inside Out** | **Outside In** |
| Efficiency | Convenience |
| Productivity | Engagement |
| Quality | Advocacy |

A high quality architecture doesn't equate to high adoption

Outside In Metrics

| **Convenience** | **Engagement** | **Advocacy** |
| Time to complete | Abandoned carts | Net promoter scores |
| Channels engaged | System workarounds | Visitor frequency |
| Number of attempts | Shadow processes | Social sentiment |

Architects need to be an accelerator and not a barrier to enhancing CX

The IT service can use CX practices to refine their BP internally.

Getting things right the first time and a zero-defect mentality are counterproductive, since they tend to create a risk-averse and uncreative atmosphere.  A self-empowered organization is the ideal environment to create knowledge.  Giving the team access to customers provides a much better understanding of the purpose and what they are trying to accomplish.  The project as a whole becomes more meaningful and they see how their work is going to impact real people.  Then let the team negotiate directly with customers to understand their priorities and take ownership of commitments.

Results, whether customer satisfaction, process outcomes or service excellence, are dependent on an organization's ability to learn, innovate, and redesign its work in response or anticipation of what is happening in the environment.  Effective organizations do this through quality decision-making by a collaborative workforce comprised of individuals motivated to continually clarify and deepen their personal vision, focus energies, develop patience, and see reality objectively.

Profiling

Awareness of the personality dynamics offers new opportunities:

-   Greater individual self-understanding and growth
-   Greater understanding of others
-   Improved communication and cooperation
-   More effective teaching and learning

## Tools for Contractual agreements

The assigned architect should be involved in the project planning and contract drafting and negotiation.

-   Define the parties' expectations before a project starts.
-   Guide parties' actions during the project.
-   Protect parties' rights.
-   Facilitate parties' ability to resolve issues quickly and inexpensively.
-   Enable a third party (judge, jury, arbitrator, or company executives) to adjudicate fairly, in the event of a dispute that cannot be resolved internally.

Read the contract over the course of the project to stay abreast of how its contents can affect the design and other decisions.

## Tools for Transparency and accountability

Managing company IT assets -- confidentiality

Continuous improvement

Being allowed to fail

Governance: ITIL, OSIMM, CMM

Audit: CMMI

Mentoring

Resource Plan

Conflict Management

## Related issues

The enterprise architect is bound to meet resistance in escalating nonconformance to the steering committee.  However, she rarely has a really strong case to make the steering committee act in her favor especially when the solution has already been implemented by the project team and is working as intended in the production environment.  Neither compromise nor confrontation works well.  It is therefore of utmost importance for an enterprise architect to convincingly negotiate.  He needs to create a win-win situation for both parties rather than falling into the trap of argumentative discussions.  It is a real test to measure the enterprise architect's interpersonal skills.

Both architecture conformance and post-implementation reviews are opportunities for an enterprise architect to engage closely with project teams.  On one hand, they allow the enterprise architect to guide the development effort and ensure that project teams conform to the strategic direction.  On the other hand, they help her backfill the enterprise architecture by consciously gathering and assimilating the best practices and lessons learned in real-life projects.  EA begins with conceptualization, idea generation and philosophical preaching, but it gains substance only after gathering practical revelations from the projects on the ground.  Hence these review processes can well be seen as mechanisms to backfill the enterprise architecture.  They should enable two-way communication between the enterprise architecture and the project teams -- guiding but also learning, governing while accepting feedback

## Managing high-risk scenarios

Defining key risk indicators helps enterprises achieve their goals, seize opportunities and seek greater return with less risk. It works at the intersection of business and IT and allows enterprises to manage and even capitalize on risk in the pursuit of their objectives.

# Proven Practices

## Describe why an architect should be involved in this skill at a corporate level

The architect works with the internal marketing and sales teams, for example, and can advise them on data correlations, intelligence and systems related to those areas, acting in a consulting capacity.  Architects rarely interface with the external customers, even in software manufacturing firms; the field team (sales reps, engineers, etc.) manages that responsibility.  One exception would be consulting companies that provide architects either on an hourly basis for solutioning or as staff augmentation for a tactical project team.

That doesn't mean that EA isn't responsible for the customer's experience: more indirectly, at the strategic level.

Enterprise Architecture is a strategic planning function that uses a methodical scientific approach to address the gaps between the goals of a business and the execution of strategy needed to reach them.  Using the TEN STRATEGIC QUESTIONS above, Enterprise Architects can capture opportunities and oversights that senior executives may miss.  One of those key questions addresses customer experience issues.  Therefore, when an organization fails to deliver good customer experiences, Enterprise Architecture, when used properly, can help to address the situation.

-   Are we targeting the right customers for the growth that we need? (Customer Profile)
-   Do we have a good understanding of what our customers want and need? (VOC)
-   Do we have a compelling value proposition to address the needs and demands of those customers? (Value Proposition)
-   Are we developing products and services that deliver on our value proposition, or is there a gap in our products and/or services that we need to address? (Products and Services)
-   Have we considered all of the channels we should be using, or are we using too many channels, to distribute our products and services to our customers? (Channels)
-   Do we have a good idea of the resources we need to deliver on our value proposition? (Resources)
-   Do we know how to use our resources sufficiently well to produce the results that customers expect? (Required Competencies)
-   Have we addressed all the cost and revenue implications of the resources, competencies, and channels that we've selected? (Cost and Revenue Models)
-   Are we reaching our customers in the geographies and locales in which they live and work, and if not, why not? (Geographies and Locales)
-   Have we relied on partners in the right way, leveraging their strengths and the cost implications of using them without opening ourselves to problems of key dependencies? (partner profiles)

[General Systems Theory: Four Types of Systems](http://www.acasa.upenn.edu/scholarly.htm){:target="_blank"}

There are four basic types of system depending on whether the parts and the whole can display choice, and therefore, be purposeful.

Only animate (people) and social systems (corporations) can be said to be purposeful.

*Systems or their parts are purposeful if, by their choices, they can produce (a) the same outcome in different ways in the same environment and (b) different outcomes in the same and different environments.*

## Primary push back and/or challenges for architects

The way we've always done it is comfortable and contributed to our success so far so why change.

How would a stakeholder engage an architect for assistance utilizing this skill?

## Benefits Management

Benefits Management is the process of monitoring for the emergence of anticipated benefits (typically specified as part of the business case for a project) and includes action to optimize the positive business impact of individual and combined benefits. Architects should continuously evaluate benefits -- financial and non-financial, immediate and long term, direct and indirect, resulting from architecture solutions as a direct indicator of the value of architecture. Benefits should be tracked, measured and reported. Deviations from the projected outcomes, positive or negative should be analyzed and implemented into architecture.
