# Description 


This capability is being depreciated in version 2.0 due to the following rationale:

-   Overlaps too much with Human Dynamics. The point of the 5 pillars are shared capabilities across specializations.
-   It is listed in Software Architecture but not other specializations. The other specializations have their own patterns, therefore either all specializations should list them or none.
-   It is too amorphous and nebulous. It is not useful in terms of a body of knowledge. Elements may be listed elsewhere.

It will not be included on certifications which are mapped to version 3.0 of the BTABoK.
