# Contributor Writing Guidelines

## Introduction

When creating a contribution to the BTABoK it is important that the content follows a uniform and coherent style making the BTABoK easy to understand and read, as well as supporting the editors in quickly publishing quality content to the profession.

The following guidelines help contributors submit quality content, and term “Subject Matter” is used to refer to the subject being described by an contributor.

##  Writing Style

Content for the ITABoK is written in third-person form which is commonly used in academic texts.

> “Writing in [third person](https://www.yourdictionary.com/third-person#websters) is writing from the third-person point of view, or outsider looking in, and uses pronouns like he, she, it, or they. It differs from the [first person](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html), which uses pronouns such as I and me, and from the [second person](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/reference/examples/examples-of-writing-in-second-person.html), which uses pronouns such as you and yours.” - **YourDictionary.com**

It is also preferable to provide use the noun (or the role of the person, architect, stakeholder, consumer) rather than using the pronoun “he” or “she” in order to avoid gender issues. 

## Content Structure

Content can sometimes vary in structure due to the nature of the subject matter. The following provides a basic generic structure.

### What is “The Subject Matter”

The introduction in the content gives a brief description of what the subject matter is. Standard definitions or quotes may be used to support this section. The aim of this section is to ensure that the reader understands what the “Subject Matter” is before reading the rest of the article. This can also be important since certain “Subject Matters” can be discussed in different contexts, this section provides the opportunity to set the “Subject Matter” in context.

> **For example:**
>
> A roadmap is a visual description which shows a plan against time for achieving one or more goals or objectives.

### Why we need “The Subject Matter”

The content describes why we need the “Subject Matter” or why the “Subject Matter” is important. Before discussing deeper concepts or practices it is important that the reader understands why the “Subject Matter” in real terms. Describe the key benefits of addressing the “Subject Matter” or the negative effects if the “Subject Matter” is not addressed.

> **For example:
> ** Roadmaps are important as they provide a common understanding for stakeholders regarding the current status of a business initiative and also a broad plan for future deliverables, goals and objectives.

### “Subject Matter” Approach

The content may list a set of key factors which are considered important when approaching the “Subject Matter”. These key factors may be expressed as small sections with a memorable statement as a title. 

> [!TIP]
>
> **For example:** 
>
> **Start small, scale fast**
> Ensure a quick delivery to an organisation.......

This provides the reader with an overview of the key factors in the “Subject Matter” and the statement as a title should make these factors more memorable to the reader. 

### Concepts

The concepts of the “Subject Matter” may be described in a series of sections which describe important areas of the “Subject Matter”. The structure and naming of the concept sections will vary depending on the “Subject Matter” and how the contributor wants to present the “Subject Matter” to the reader. It is important when writing the concept sections that the reader feels that the sections flow from one to the other and that knowledge is gained step by step. 

One technique is to create an overview concept which links the following concept sections so the reader understands how the different concept sections are connected. 

Another technique is to start the concept at an abstract level and use a “top-down” description describing the concept in more detail as the reader moves down the sections.

### Techniques and Canvases

Content may contain practical advice from the contributor regarding how to work with the “Subject Matter”. This may involve providing a canvas or a technique which will help the reader to actively practice the “Subject Matter”. When describing how to use a canvas or a technique the following structure may be useful.

1. Provide a short text describing why the technique or canvas is useful
2. Describe any preparation that that should be done before starting
3. Describe in sequential steps (Step1, Step2, Step3….) illustrating how to use the technique or canvas for the reader

### References and Further Reading

The content may uses other content from books, articles or texts, or the contributor may wish to indicate topics for further reading. This can be provided using a “References and Further Reading” section at the end of the content which contains a list of books, articles or texts which have been used, or which are useful to the reader for further reading on the “Subject Matter”.
