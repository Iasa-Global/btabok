# BTABoK Scenarios

This article is based on scenarios to help individuals and organizations use the BTABoK in growing their practice and maturity. The first priority is to identify 'scenarios' which are common moments or needs where the BTABoK might be helpful in delivering better architecture. The article will first give an overview of the scenarios and some basic guiding principles and then will expand on those in individual articles or even learning shots and training. 

Most of the BTABoK uses third person voice to ensure that it has some academic rigor and can be understood that it is not a personal opinion. However, in these scenarios, we will be giving direct advice and thus we will switch to first and/or second person. 

Here is the starting list of scenarios,  feel free to add additional scenarios as you find them either in github issues or by adding a new scenaro to this list: 

- I am an aspiring architect - how do I grow?

- I am a solution architect, I have been asked to produce an architecture for a new product?

- I am an application architect, what should I do during product development?

- I am a solution architect, I have been asked to help with a package selection, or buy vs build.

- I am looking after an architecture practice, what should I do?

- I am have been asked to perform an architecture review, can the BTABoK help me with this?

- I am a business architect, how can the BTABoK help me approach my job?

- How does the BTABoK apply to enterprise architecture?

- I have a set of stakeholders that are complicated and I want to work with them better. 

- I am a consultant working with a client to try to make recommendations on the best approach to their work, how can I use the BTABoK?

- How do I deal with all these canvases and how are they linked?

- How do I update a legacy system?
