The week in the life designer is an as-is and to-be brainstorming tool which helps to identify the kind of time an architect or a team is spending and one what. It is meant to be printed or used in a whiteboarding environment where you mark the kinds of tasks you are doing as well as how well they are being done and/or how effective they are.

To use the canvas simply use the icons on the left (or add additional icons or text) to understand your average work week. Then mark the tasks that are useful and beneficial all the way down to the ones that are not. This can be done as a group exercise.
