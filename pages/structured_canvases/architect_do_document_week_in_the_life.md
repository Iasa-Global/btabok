The week in the life designer is an as-is and to-be brainstorming tool which helps to identify the kind of time an architect or a team is spending and one what. It is meant to be printed or used in a whiteboarding environment where you mark the kinds of tasks you are doing as well as how well they are being done and/or how effective they are.
