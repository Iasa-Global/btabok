Using the team goals canvas, you will bring the architects together to help understand their strategy for the architecture practice along with business targets. See below. The team should look at specific measures related to Value, Customer(s), Processes, and People to understand how the team can best create outcomes. This will tie their initiatives back to measurable objectives and value dashboarding. Measures should be done in the target state with time.
