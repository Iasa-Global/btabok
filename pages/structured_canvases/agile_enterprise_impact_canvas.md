## Overview

The agile impact canvas is used to describe the overall impact of agile methods on an enterprise, team, or domain. The canvas is a tool for thinking about impacts to business models, organization structures, culture, and more. It works best if used as a facilitation tool with a multi-faceted team who are brainstorming the best ways to make agile work in their organizations.

## Common usage scenarios

The agile enterprise impact canvas is a strategic tool to help understand how ready the organization is for agile concepts and whether those are business agility related and/or development agility related. 

The Agile Enterprise Canvas connects with many of the other agile canvases such as Value Stream Designer, Agile Team Designer, Agile Automation Designer and the standard (agile built in) canvases like ARS, ASDs and Core canvases. 

When considering whether the organization, domain and teams are ready for agile it is very important to how the process will impact planning and financing. The notion of product thinking and roadmapping are essential as well as clear connection between roadmap elements. This portion of architecture is often overlooked on early agile adoptions.
