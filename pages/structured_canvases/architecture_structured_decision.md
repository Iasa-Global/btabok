The Business Technology Architecture Body of Knowledge (BTABOK) highlights the critical role of Architectural Decision Records (ASDRs) in successful IT architecture. ASDRs provide:

- **Traceability:** They link architectural decisions to business drivers, strategic goals, and Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs), clarifying the context and rationale behind choices.
- **Communication:** They act as a central repository of architectural knowledge, facilitating a shared understanding of the system's design and evolution among stakeholders.
- **Governance:** They offer a mechanism for reviewing and approving significant architectural decisions, ensuring alignment with enterprise architecture principles.
- **Risk Management:** By documenting potential drawbacks and alternatives, ADRs enable proactive risk mitigation.
- **Learning & Improvement:** They allow architects to revisit past decisions, analyze their outcomes, and learn from both successes and failures.

## How to Use this Card

This ADR template provides a structured framework for documenting architectural decisions. Here's how to use it effectively:

1. **Name:** Assign a clear and concise name to the decision. For example, "Selection of Database Technology for Customer Relationship Management System."

2. **Context:** Describe the factors influencing the decision. BTABOK encourages consideration of:
   
   - **Technological:** Existing systems, technology limitations, and industry trends.
   - **Political:** Organizational structures, stakeholder interests, and power dynamics.
   - **Social:** User needs, cultural factors, and ethical implications.
   - **Project Local:** Budget constraints, deadlines, and team skillsets.

3. **Traceability:** Connect the decision back to its source, such as a business goal, strategic initiative, or ASR. This clarifies the decision's origin and importance.

4. **Scope and Tier:**
   
   - **Scope:** Define the area impacted by the decision, whether it's a component, subsystem, or the entire enterprise.
   - **Tier:** Determine the criticality of the decision based on BTABOK's safety criticality tiers. A higher tier indicates a greater impact in case of failure.

5. **Options:** Explore potential solutions, using diagrams to illustrate each option. Analyze the pros and cons of each approach within the defined context.

6. **Decision:** Clearly state the chosen option and provide a detailed justification, referencing the analysis performed in the "Options" section.
