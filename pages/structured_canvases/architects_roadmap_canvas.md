| Complexity | This is a measure of the architectural complexity of the project thus it's need for architecture effort. |   |
| Compliance | This column represents the level of compliance issues expected in the project. It describes regulatory or other highly sensitive aspects which will impact the project. |   |
| Governance | This column represents the level of oversight and governance expected in the project. For example projects which deeply impact the financial status of the company or have high compliance factors. |   |
| Time Columns | Time increments should scale upward meaning closest time should be in short increments and farthest right in longer increments. |   |
| Component/Release Lines | The lines/bars and milestones indicate the expected length of the project with its associated milestones and crossover lines represent dependencies between projects. | Lean Business Case (expected timeline) |
