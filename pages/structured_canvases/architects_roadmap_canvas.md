| Business Case/Project   | The number of rows in the roadmap can be divided at any level of **Scope** but most commonly the roadmap is used at the business case/project level.                                                | Strategy Scorecard (provides initiatives) |
| Value                   | This is the expected return from the business case.                                                                                                                                                 | Lean Business Case (expected return)      |
| Complexity              | This is a measure of the architectural complexity of the project thus it's need for architecture effort.                                                                                            |                                           |
| Compliance              | This column represents the level of compliance issues expected in the project. It describes regulatory or other highly sensitive aspects which will impact the project.                             |                                           |
| Governance              | This column represents the level of oversight and governance expected in the project. For example projects which deeply impact the financial status of the company or have high compliance factors. |                                           |
| Time Columns            | Time increments should scale upward meaning closest time should be in short increments and farthest right in longer increments.                                                                     |                                           |
| Component/Release Lines | The lines/bars and milestones indicate the expected length of the project with its associated milestones and crossover lines represent dependencies between projects.                               | Lean Business Case (expected timeline)    |
