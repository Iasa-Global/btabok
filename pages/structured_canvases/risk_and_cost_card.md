The Risk and Cost Card allows the evaluation of risk or costs as well as the relationship between a risk and possible costs. It can be used to catalog either risks alone, costs alone, or risk/cost combinations.Â

| Risk                       | The risk being considered. May include risk categories from risk management. The probability should be described as a percentage. The incident amount includes a cost/damage that would occur if the risk happens. The reoccurrence would include a possible repeatable time and volume. | N/A                             |
| Risk Mitigators            | These are elements in the architecture, the context or the organization which will or can mitigate the risk.                                                                                                                                                                             | N/A                             |
| Design Impacts             | These are specific design elements that would be used to mitigate or address the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [View/Viewpoint](viewpoint_template_card.md){:target="_blank"}, Decision Record |
| Cost(s)                    | The cost or cost(s) to be considered. The total amount represents a way of calculating TCO of the include cost(s).                                                                                                                                                                       | N/A                             |
| Cost Alternatives          | Options to avoid the cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [Decision Record](architecture_decision_record.md){:target="_blank"}                 |
| Cost Impact Considerations | The design implications and or decisions which are impacted by the cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [View/Viewpoint](viewpoint_template_card.md){:target="_blank"}, [Decision Record](architecture_decision_record.md){:target="_blank"} |
