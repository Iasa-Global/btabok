# Overview

The architects engagement touch points is used to understand the stakeholder(s) and their levels that the architecture practice 'touches'. The canvas is used by putting sticky notes on the stakeholders and their types of interactions. The columns represent 'types' which translate to areas of interaction. For example the Sr VP of Sales would be in the Biz Management, Exec cell. If this is a meeting or document use corresponding icons. In this way, the practice can define it's primary interaction points in IT, in Business, and as a part of change management (portfolio down to solution scope).

## How to use the Canvas

1. Identify stakeholders across rows, such as executives, senior managers, employees, and others.

2. Across the columns, list key architectural aspects like business management and IT management.

3. Utilize the symbols on the right to mark activities, such as meetings or ideation, in the intersecting cells, based on where stakeholders engage with each aspect.

Understanding these interactions is critical because it aligns the architectural work with stakeholder needs, ensuring that decisions are informed, relevant, and strategically sound. This understanding promotes effective communication, fosters collaboration, and ultimately contributes to the success of the architecture within the organization.
