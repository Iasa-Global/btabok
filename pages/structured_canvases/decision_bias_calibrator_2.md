This tool is designed to help identify and mitigate potential  cognitive biases  that can  impede  rational decision-making  in the context of  architectural strategy and execution. ItÂ complements other architectural practices like architecture roadmap development and stakeholder engagement by ensuring that decisions made during these processes are sound and less susceptible to cognitive biases.
