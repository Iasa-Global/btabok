# Canvas Overview

The product canvas is a strategic business planning tool used by product managers and UX designers to describe a product or service offering. It helps development teams focus on the target audience, their needs and the solutions the product will provide. The canvas is helpful for brainstorming ideas, aligning stakeholders around a common vision, and setting product roadmaps. 

The product canvas is a valuable tool for architects because it helps them to understand the product vision and ensure that the architecture aligns with the business goals. It can also be used to communicate the product vision to other stakeholders.

The product canvas fits into strategy by helping you to define your product’s target market, value proposition, and competitive advantage. It fits into execution by helping you to develop a product roadmap and identify the key metrics that will be used to measure success.
