The Iasa default job descriptions are published as an aid to organizations setting up or reorganizing their architecture practice. These job descriptions in combination with the Iasa skills taxonomy, engagement model, training and certifications serve as the baseline by which organizations may define a robust [architecture practice](architecture_practice.md){:target="_blank"} with balanced and focused architecture practices.

# The Value of Using Iasa Education Components

Iasa is a global non-profit professional association for all types of architects which has existed since 2003 in its current form. It exists solely to make architecture into a stable, valuable and trustworthy profession. By utilizing Iasa models an organization makes use of best practices from independent architects from all over the world. Specifically, as Iasa does not have corporate membership, companies can be sure that all Iasa programs are free from vendor or technology company influence.

The value of using the Iasa Education models can be summarized easily. Iasa is the only true architect association in the world and has countless numbers of professionals involved in developing the next generation of standards for architecture practice.

-   By going with Iasa definitions you ensure the availability of quality professionals with clear levels and credentials
-   Ensure that your job definitions are consistent with industry best practice
-   Reduce the risk of maintaining internal job categories disconnected from industry
-   Grow the success of architect teams through standard training and certification in practical skills

# Structuring A Team

The Iasa CoE describes the rough structure of a connected and successful architect organization. Successful architecture teams work together and touch every aspect of a business. They report into the technology organization but a majority of their work involves [stakeholders](stakeholders.md){:target="_blank"} from every group in the enterprise. The goal of the entire team is first and foremost the generation of value to the enterprise through technology. This value can be in financial, constituent, reuse, market growth or other elements of the Iasa Architect Value Framework (see Iasa website).

# Skills Taxonomy and Value Focus

To deliver value to the organization the architect team must have the appropriate focus and the appropriate skills. A skilled architect team will deliver many secondary value components but the focus must never veer from the core value proposition and skillset, known as business technology strategy. The business technology strategy (architecture) describes the value generated from every significant technology decisions made in the organization. It is an ongoing set of decisions as well as the models, documents and delivery of the strategy and all of the components necessary to optimizing and innovating within the framework. It also includes any processes, people and capabilities necessary for the architecture team.

Architecture value is delivered through employing knowledgeable, skilled and experienced architects both internally (employees) and externally (staff augmentation or project based). Iasa job descriptions are based on a rigorous skills taxonomy which has been worked out over the last 8 years between Iasa members and thought leaders and is maintained through the Iasa Board of Education. Adopting a clear and concise skills taxonomy is essential for the success of any architecture initiative as it will control the capabilities of the final team.

The Iasa Skills Taxonomy is unique in the industry as it is both extremely detailed and descriptive as well as connects the specializations together in a shared skill set.

# Business Architect

The business architect provides leadership of business initiatives through technology strategy by participating in the development of a business strategy to accomplish specific business goals. They provide [innovation](innovate.md){:target="_blank"} and opportunity recognition within business units. Specifically the business architect has mastered the delivery of value through technology support of business strategy. The business architect has developed their understanding of business valuation, business process and business strategy delivery. They act as a liaison from the technology groups to enhance business development and have tremendously advanced skills in business valuation of technology as well has human dynamics.

The business architect understands the business unit and organization within which they function using both formal methods, such as modeling, as well as informal techniques. They will likely have significant experience within the industry and the particular business function where they work. The business architect functions as a part of the business team as a trusted partner and the models they create may be used to extend beyond just the application of technology strategy as they give useful and powerful pictures of the processes, people and capabilities of the business unit.

# Solutions Role Activities

The Business architect may act as a solutions architect within the realm of a particularly challenging business related project or as a part of a general role activity within the current employer. Acting within this role the business architect would coordinate and work with other architecture specialists such as infrastructure, software and information or may be required to develop architectures within these areas themselves. However, a business architect is primarily responsible for the business systems themselves and is not primarily a delivery job function. It is left to the employer to designate the number and amount of information architecture design and decision functions of the information architect in relation to; a) the systems they own and b) the projects to which they are assigned.

# Ownership

The business architect owns the technology value of a particular business unit (vertically organized) or a [business c](business_capabilities.md){:target="_blank"}apability (horizontally organized). They ensure that all technology strategies developed deliver exactly the amount of value specified during inception. They own the project prioritization and technology governance processes for all aspects of business that is owned by their business unit. In addition, the business architect owns and develops [business models](business_models.md){:target="_blank"} which will illuminate their technology strategy and participates in any business planning activity which makes use of these models.
