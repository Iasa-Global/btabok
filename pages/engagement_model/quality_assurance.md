# What is Quality Assurance

Any business or organization which produces services or products wants to ensure that they maintain the expected quality for their customers.
Products and services which are technology-based rely on the architecture to provide the foundation or framework for design.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the architecture meets the expected quality since the following designs and implementation will be
based on the architecture.

Quality assurance (or QA) is the process by which we can ensure that an architecture meets the expected quality standards. This process should
check both the process by which the architecture is created as well as testing the resulting architecture.

Quality Assurance is commonly practiced through two methods that attempt to ensure that the architecture meets the quality expectations,
validation and verification.

# Why do we need Quality Assurance

Perhaps the most important reason for quality assurance is that the customer receives a product or service at the expected quality. Without
quality assurance it is difficult to assess the level of quality before the product or service reaches the customer. Low-quality deliveries to
the customer eat at trust, and damage business reputation. This has a significantly negative effect on business. Since most technology
products and services are built upon an architecture it is of critical importance that the architecture maintains a good quality.

Performing quality assurance throughout the architecture and development process helps to find design defects and errors early in the development
cycle. Defects which are found early in the cycle are less expensive to fix and require less effort.

Quality assurance supports the development of architecture to the right quality, where quality is often a trade-off with time and cost. When
developing an architecture it is important to ensure the right balance of quality, and ensure that the architecture is fit for its intended
purpose. Performing good quality assurance practices supports getting the balance right.

Quality assurance applies not only to testing the quality of the end-product but also to the process by which the product is developed.
This also applies to the process by which we ensure quality in the architecture. This is particularly important in industries that have to
comply with strong regulatory requirements and [governance]{.underline}. Quality assurance supports [governance](governance.md){:target="_blank"} ensuring that standards and regulations are followed.

# Quality Assurance Approach

## Quality Assurance Throughout the Whole Process

Quality assurance is something that is performed throughout the whole process of developing an architecture. Don't leave it to the end of
product development. Starting quality assurance early and continually checking the architecture will lead to detecting ineffective design,
errors and problems early in the process, making it less expensive to fix.

## Architects Outside the Team

Involve architects, who are outside the team, in the quality assurance process. Architects who work with an architecture day-in-day-out can
become blind to design defects. Involving architects from outside the team can often result in detecting defects much faster and even the
discovery of new ways of improving quality.

## Cost and Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance costs effort and time to operate, and can also cost products in terms of time-to-market. It is important to get the right
balance of quality assurance against cost, just enough to ensure the expected quality. Some organizations may feel that an easy way to cut
costs is to reduce expensive QA activities, however this can have significantly negative effects on business.

*"If you think that Quality Assurance is expensive, wait until you see the cost of poor quality."*

## Wasting Time

The effect of poor quality is the expenditure of effort on non-value activities, for example, correcting mistakes, provision of extra
support, appeasing unsatisfied customers, or performing ineffective workarounds.

*"Time waste differs from material waste in that there can be no salvage.
The easiest of all wastes, and the hardest to correct, is the waste of
time, because wasted time does not litter the floor like wasted
material."* **- Henry Ford, Ford Motors**

As Henry Ford points out, waste of time cannot be regained, it is lost
without gaining any value. Good quality assurance practices help to
avoid, correct and facilitate effective use of time.

# Verifying the Architecture

Verification of the architecture asks the question: *"Are we building the
architecture right?"*. Verification of the architecture comes before
validation. Verification attempts to ensure the quality of the
architecture before the construction of the product or service based on
the architecture.

## Architecture Way of Working

One way to ensure quality in the architecture is to have well-defined
processes and activities for developing the architecture, and check that
these processes are followed. This provides clarity regarding the way of
working and ensures that the architects have a common practice.
Weaknesses in quality may appear if practices are unclear or missing.

It is also important that the way of working defines roles and
responsibilities, this clarifies responsibility and accountability for
the various activities and deliverables.

## Architecture Deliverables

Defining expected architecture [deliverables]() provides an
effective method of detailing expectations from the architecture work,
and provides underlying support for reviews and inspections. Checklists
provide a simple method for ensuring that all required deliverables are
present when the architecture is delivered.

The definition of a deliverable shall describe the expected contents of
the deliverable, for example, expected topics and views of the
architecture.

## Reviews and Walkthroughs

Reviews and walkthroughs are a great way to ensure quality in the
architecture before it is published for use. These allow the architect
to explore designs, gain feedback and improve the quality of the
architecture. There are many different types of reviews, and the reviews
an organization puts in place will depend on the way the organization
works and the business context. Reviews generally involve several
stakeholders, architects, product owners, lead developers, etc.... The
following sections describe some different types of reviews.

## Content review

A content review focuses on the content of the architecture. These types
of reviews often focus on a specific design aspect of the architecture
or are used to evaluate selected design alternatives. These reviews
focus on the quality of the architecture, to ensure that it is "fit for
purpose".

These types of reviews can be used to evaluate different aspects of the
architecture, for example, significant functional design, quality
attributes, information models, solution context or explore a concept.

Content reviews can be conducted formally with a protocol based on the
expected content of a given deliverable, or they may be informal as a
way of verifying ideas or concepts during the architecture development.
It is recommended that content reviews be performed regularly throughout
the development of the architecture.

## Way of working review

Way of working reviews focus on the process and activities by which the
architecture is developed. This review aims to continually improve
architecture practices to ensure that they are effective and promote
quality. The aim of such reviews is to assess if the current way of
working is resulting in good quality architectures, and to explore what
can be done to continually improve quality.

Note that there doesn't have to be a specific quality problem to hold a
way of working review, this should be a continual effort to improve
quality.

## Delivery review

A delivery review is often a formal review performed before publishing
an architecture, or a significant change to an architecture. This type
of review is often used to check that all required architecture
deliverables are complete and that all required content is present
before publication to stakeholders. This type of review is often
performed to a protocol or checklist, and can even consider aspects of
the deliverables such as language, document formats, coherence,
correctness and readability.

## Peer-reviews

An architect can continuously review an architecture against standards
and industry methods, however, it is often more effective to review
architecture decisions and concepts with other architects. Reviewing an
architecture with a collective group of architects will broaden both the
architecture competence, provide different perspectives and gain a
broader agreement for concepts. Performing peer-reviews regularly leads
to stronger architecture solutions.

## External-reviews

Using external parties to review an architecture provides an independent
assessment. This can be a useful technique to counter any architecture
bias within an organization, and raise questions that the internal
organization simply has not considered. An external review, if performed
by persons external to the organization, can also approach politically
sensitive or [cultural](culture.md){:target="_blank"} issues which are perhaps difficult
to address by the internal organization. External reviews are often not
as frequent as peer reviews, they are used at the beginning of a large
assignment to validate the direction of an architecture, or close to
architecture delivery to ensure quality.

## Modelling Standards

The provision of common models and standards within architecture
supports the reuse of tried and tested design methods. Using common
models provides a common language for describing the architecture, this
makes the architecture understandable to other architects and
stakeholders. UML and Archimate are examples of such modelling
languages. Providing a standard set of rules for describing an
architecture makes the architecture easier to review and improves
quality.

## Automated Architecture Analysis

Some modelling tools provide analysis and simulation methods to analyze
architectures. This is a useful way of testing architecture designs
before implementation. This method may be used to analyze and simulate
processes that carry significant risks if they fail, or processes that
are expensive to implement and change. The use of analysis and
simulation means that errors and defects can be identified at an early
stage.

# Validating the Architecture

Validating the architecture asks the question: *"Are we building the
right architecture?"*. Validation of the architecture comes after
verification. Validation tests the effect of the architecture after
construction of the feature, product or service. Since architecture is
mainly a planning activity for implementation, the emphasis is perhaps
more on verification, however even after implementation it is important
to test that the architecture meets the requirements.

## Proof of Concepts (POC)

One way to test an architectural concept is to make a prototype
implementation and see if it works. This is generally referred to as a
Proof of Concept, or POC. This is a very common way to explore and test
architecture designs and measure desired effects. While this is not the
same as a production-quality implementation, it does reduce risk. A key
principle with POCs is that they are experiments, and should not be used
as if they are production-ready code. After validating the POC, the
implementation will likely need to be re-written for production quality
implementation.

## Requirements Validation

Once a product or service is implemented and executable, the requirements on the architecture can be validated. [Quality attributes](quality_attributes.md){:target="_blank"} provide a set of non-functional requirements on the architecture, but these can still be tested. For example, performance and robustness as quality attributes are often tested before
product release.

Significant functional requirements on the architecture are also
validated through functional testing. This may be tested and validated
through functional tests on the product or service. For example, a
functional test for logging in the product may act as a verification of
a logging requirement in the architecture.

The architecture may be required to meet regulatory requirements and it
is often very important to validate these requirements after
implementation.

## Inspections

Inspections are related to governance and may perform detailed checks
that procedures and processes were followed during development, as well
as checking that a product conforms to a given standard. Inspections are
often carried out close to the final release of a product since they are
detailed and time-consuming. An inspection may be carried out by an
internal part of the organization, but they are often carried out by a
regulatory body if a product is under regulation, for example, FDA (Food
and Drug Administration, USA), or NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
USA).

# Measure Effect and Outcomes

Even after the launch of a product or service, it is important to
measure the effect of the architectural change. Expected outcomes are
often detailed in [objectives](objectives.md){:target="_blank"}, these can be measured to
assess if the architecture is performing as expected. Rather than just
validating the architecture against requirements, this validates that
the architecture is delivering value.
