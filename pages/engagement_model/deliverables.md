# Deliverables

So what are architecture deliverables? In general architecture deliverables are treated as large documents for projects. What is often called the architecture description. The notion of the architecture description is well documented in the iso 042010 Standard up by the ISO. The ice 04-2010 provides for architecture descriptions at that connect to views and viewpoints. And deliver on a description of a particular architecture.

Architecture deliverables often extend significantly further than a particular architecture description. They may include research into new technologies, they may include new business models and business cases. They may include proposals and power points to management or any number of and of deliverables documents for stake holders.

## Description

In general architecture teams must describe and define their deliverables in a number of different fashions. First they should describe their deliverables in terms of stake holders. Second, they should define their deliverables in terms of ownership influence and importance. Finally, they should define the deliverables in terms of capabilities, domain and specialization.

# Themes

Deliverables connect the architect to the organization. As one CITA-Professional puts it, 'they are what we leave behind'. The architect deliverable is imagined to be a long lasting, well used part of the enterprise decision-making process and from time to time that is true. In many cases though architects work on deliverables that are simply influencers or are unused by stakeholders.Communication and Thinking over Documentation and Detailed Design

This point is reaffirmed in numerous places in the BTABoK. Architects are innovators, change agents, transformation specialists, visionaries. They are forward focused instead control focused or backwards focused. They are builders instead of reviewers. All of these focal points are reaffirmed in the deliverables the architecture team.

In the Iasa Engagement model, deliverables should be considered tools for thinking, communication and leadership instead of documentation or large detailed designs. The organization has many staff members of different types which create managed documentation and the architecture team is often a small percentage of these staff members. Every piece of documentation must be maintained over time. It therefore makes sense to create as little maintained documentation as possible over time.

## Don't Confuse Views and Viewpoints with Deliverables

[Views and viewpoints](views.md){:target="_blank"} are used to describe a specific system (people, process and technology) inside an architecture description within a particular architecture [context](scope_context.md){:target="_blank"}. They should be left up to the architect to decide which are necessary in most cases. Deliverables on the other hand are items that the team delivers to the enterprise, client or organization. These are very often completely different things as deliverables may include meetings, presentations, influence, decision points in addition to an architecture description.

## Influence is not Ownership

In numerous organizations the architects are primarily influencers of other teams deliverables. When doing a deliverables analysis, the architects should review the deliverables they own against those they only influence. While value focused influence may help the organization achieve its objectives, it is less helpful to the architects achieving a value oriented and well received engagement model as owners are traditionally given credit for successes and value. The architect team should strive to own the most valued business and technology strategy deliverables and their contents with a focus on owning *as a team* the business technology strategy of the organization. Note: in large teams many business architects will own pure business models which does not reduce the primary overall team recognition as business technology strategists.If No One Reads It, Dump It

Based on architecture being communication and thinking over documentation, it is necessary to reduce the deliverables and the documentation steps for the team overall. Usage by stakeholders and the architecture team are the primary measures of efficacy in deliverables. A document which has not been opened in a year is likely less useful to the enterprise than one that is referenced daily by a stakeholder or the team. If it is not used, archive and delete it as it will slow down the agility of the overall team.

# Guidelines for Iasa Engagement Model

In reality architects are challenged with numerous, often ephemeral, deliverables based on stakeholders demands and can find it difficult to say no to powerful stakeholders. This real constraint causes a lot of difficulty in determining exactly what an architecture team should create.

# Guidelines for Deciding Deliverables

To develop an effective deliverables strategy consider the following elements:

1.  Focus and Brand -- The architecture team will be judged based on its goals and brand within the organization. Align deliverables to this brand. For example, if the team is targeting a growth in recognition for innovation, the deliverables should be aligned to business cases, innovation, ideation and other forward looking activities.
2.  Recognition and Usage -- Which deliverables will be most recognized and used throughout the client environment. The team should provide deliverables that are used and recognized and preferably owned by the architects first. All other deliverables come later.
3.  Time on delivery -- Architects deliver change. The Iasa Engagement model does not provide for a team that sits in a corner and does big documents all day. If deliverables are taking the team away from delivery of change and growth, they should be jettisoned.
4.  Deliverable type -- Review all types of deliverables including meetings and research and influence.
5.  Team size -- The team size will determine the number of deliverables it can manage outside of the most essential to change management. Do not specialize the team and create large enterprise deliverables unless they are used and the team can maintain and own them over time without lessoning its focus on delivery.
6.  Team makeup -- Take a full skills inventory of the team and ensure the teams skills are aligned with the deliverable ownership.

## Delivery Types and Outputs

The following table lists the types of output & types of engagement delivered during each stage in the lifecycle the type is referenced throughout the engagement model indicating how an architect will be involved. Any of these elements may be considered deliverables if they are repeated multiple times by different architects in the architecture methodology.

| **Type ** | **Example ** |
| --- | --- |
| **Document/Artifact ** | Office document (Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc.) |
| **Collaboration ** | Meeting (e.g. ARB, Roadmap envisioning) |
| **Model ** | Description or representation of a business, process or system |
| **Advisory ** | Formal advice delivered from architecture practice |
| **Tool ** | Architecture Repository, Lifecycle Mgmt, Project Mgmt/Product, Tools |
| **Decision ** | Decision made by appropriate governance structure (e.g. ISLT, ARB) |
| **Influence ** | Any business contact where architecture can be promoted, leveraged or presented in the context of delivering business value. |

## Deciding on Deliverables

The engagement steering committee should decide on deliverables and then validate that model through the entire architecture practice using the following steps.

| **Step ** | **Description ** |
| --- | --- |
| **Overall Complexity ** | Simple is better in early phases of the architecture maturity model. A list of basic deliverables and a more advanced set of deliverables are provided below. |
| **Strategy and Execution Lifecycle ** | Meeting (e.g. ARB, Roadmap envisioning) |
| **Architecture Methodology (Lifecycle)** | Description or representation of a business, process or system |
| **Stakeholder Mapping** | Use the power/interest grid, personas and other techniques and each team member to describe the stakeholder community. Map deliverables to the most important stakeholders. |
| **Current Deliverables** | Use the Iasa engagement methodology to describe current deliverables in terms of phase, ownership and impact. |
| **Target Deliverables** | Create a preferred list of deliverables by phase keeping them as simple as possible. Assign deliverables by role and connect to Architecture Repository, Lifecycle Mgmt, Project Mgmt/Product, Tools |
| **Templates and Guidelines ** | Where possible create a template list to ease the burden of deliverable creation and a common brand. Spend extra time on making these templates extremely attractive in line with the brand of the team. Update them regularly. |
| **Architect Team Review ** | Have each member of the architect community validate the engagement deliverables (sitting out should not be an option). By creating buy off in this manner each architect will know what to deliver to what stakeholder and when. |

## Assign Deliverable Ownership

Ownership of a deliverable does not end with the phase/project/product timeline in which it was created. Any deliverable which will retain its value over time should be assigned based on capability, internal domain and specialization.

## Align Handoff Between Architects

Architects function at different stages and scopes around the enterprise lifecycle. The handoffs and deliverables should be aligned so that they always have an owner and are updated according to the appropriate phase, specialization and [scope](scope_context.md){:target="_blank"}.
